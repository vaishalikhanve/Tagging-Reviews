I use the timeline on this app daily to pinpoint my family's whereabouts and isn't working. It says missing visit for almost the entire day. I was at one location for 2 1/2 hours, left there and spent the next 3 hours at another location then made 2 stops on my way home. According to your apps timeline, I was absolutely driving, or "moving" for 6 hours????

Great app, but misses being the best all round navigation app as it does not show speed limits or alert you of speed cameras. I use it with Android auto & would much prefer satellite imagery as opposed to the default view. Waze does not look as slick, but offers substantially better functionality & alerts for drivers.
 
When I select Directions on a location, the app no longer automatically sets my current location as the Starting Point, please fix this. + Timeline has been so inaccurate for the past few months that I keep having to manually edit the days events. + Please allow "Explore City" to be turned off. + Allow the For You tab to be turned off. And the red dot on the For You tab won't go away. + Directions & transit info load slowly.
 
This app used to be great up until the Android update about a week ago. Now, it is horrible. It is almost impossible to exit out of this app. For some reason, when I click the dual window button then all it does is shrink and there is no way to close it at all. Maybe it's just the update, but this app is now extremely hard to use.
 
Not proper and accurate every time. Sometimes it take person on that places where there is no CAR route. Two lane roads not shows as shortcut route while we find directions for any place. When we going on the route which shows in the map for directions to a place and unfortunately, if the route is jaam or interrupted then GOOGLE MAP not show any interior route to sort out the problem. I don't know what is the problem but I request to GOOGLE please sort out these problems.
 
The search function has steadily dropped in quality over time to the point where it is almost useless. If you are searching for a specific address, it is still fine, but general searches now only show you locations that have paid to be advised. This app used to be a great way to local businesses and get to know an area. Now it only shows big chains.
 
Worked pretty well but it told me to drive straight into a lake. The car was a rental because I recently ran over an employee and her head dented my hood. No I did not get the rental insurance.
 
Was perfect... but a few months ago a update started causing the app to minimize randomly. When I'm in the process of using the app I want it to be a full screen while I'm driving, taking the time to remaximize the app takes my eyes off the road and it's really annoying. I cant find a setting to deactivate that feature like I can with the YouTube app.
 
There are more and more toll roads these days. Many people either never use the toll road or always use toll roads. Right now the default is to always use toll roads and every time I have to switch the hard to find check box to avoid toll roads. It can not be hard for Google to give me the option of avoiding toll roads. I'm assuming Google is getting a ton of money from the toll road operators to keep it this way. I've waited years for this simple option. I give up. Moving on to a different app. Update 2018. I am impressed. Looks like my gripe has been addressed. There is now a nice toggle for avoiding toll roads by default. Thank you.
 
Look, this does what it says it does. Great. It also bombards you with nonsense like "Please tell us where you live?", "Where you work?". Just lose that stuff, it's annoying. Oh, and for the users who are addicted to adding nonexistent places - How does that improve anything for anyone except boost your ego? That goes double for the wonderful people that add photos of their house, car, etc. to places having less than nothing to do with them (like public parks!). Stop the nonsense, it just detracts from everyone else's use of the application.
 
Active routing is useless. Cost me so much time, keeps telling me to get on and off the freeway 20+ miles from my stop. The app only works if you use it like a paper map and plan your own route.
 
I run delivery for work, and maps is fairly lackluster. I've ended up driving past my destination regularly as I'm told my destination is on the right. The routing sometimes makes no sense and if I chose to take a different route, maps will try to take me back to the nonsensical route. I'm using Waze from here forward.
 
New update make the app less user friendly. App expands area on a search after I intentionally foccussed on a specific area, that banner"search this area" pops up and will not go away, and business name are not showing up when zoomed in on. Google is missing the mark with their customer base more and more. Not the same company anymore
 
Maps is a great app, but one of the recent updates has killed the performance. Now it's very slow and laggy. Never used to be the case, I'm on an Axon 7 so cpu/ram shouldn't be an issue. Could someone from Google please follow up with me?
 
I work as delivery as well. This app malfunction all the time. It keeps on sending me to the wrong areas... makes me join m5 and m25 motorways (which are hard to come out of) for no reason at all. The other day it took me outside of london.
 
Even with the updated versions and a brand new Blackberry Keyone phone, the Google Maps always freezes and shuts down. Believe when I say it is not my phone but only my Google Maps App causing my phone to slow down and freeze. It's extremely upsetting and causes me a lot of stress especially when I am driving in a new city and get lost. I really need the maps at that time. I am switching to Waze now, listening to my boyfriend.
 
Well Google, you have done it. You have made the Maps effectively unusable for a small business to keep private maps of their clients using the MY MAPS editor and then access them through MAPS to be able to navigate to them. I understand that your goal is to get me to put all the "businesses" I know on Maps as searchable public locations, BUT, a significant number of my business clients are private individuals in private residences who would not appreciate having their information made searchable on a public map. Besides that, I don't want my business clients public thereby allowing my competitors to be able to find them and try to steal them. I have come up with a work around but I will be actively looking for an alternative to your product.
 
I updated the app today and it now, it's SUPER slow when it comes to loading and getting navigation instructions!! I've been trying to get directions for the last 5 minutes and it's still "Trying to Find best Route".
 
Update seemed great but is slow af and buggy as hell. Changed jobs and old work location keeps popping up despite changing saved work location AND deleting location history data to remove the offending address. It still pops up. Also, would love the option of turning off the mini window when navigating. I'm trying to adjust audio book volume level, etc. and stupid tiny window is just a damn nuisance. Otherwise crisp.
 
Since Samsung did an update a couple weeks ago, Google maps have not been able find my location. Always states gps signal lost and it has me placed in a different state. Haven't been able to use the app.
 
Navigation is good, especially with lane specification. However, using Google Assistant to look up places while navigating automatically adds it to your route. You have to click to cancel, which distracts from driving. I had an additional stop added to my commute on accident, making me late. It's a serious flaw and safety issue.
 
This app has steadily gone downhill since the last few updates. Its constantly dropping signal for no apparent reason and doesnt give voice direction half the time. It used to be so much better.
 
I've used this app for years from Florida to Hawaii to Nova Scotia with excellent results. I even use it locally to check traffic. Sure, there have been a couple of glitches, but they're few and far between.
 
Location miles off for the first several minutes when opening app (consistently), directions takes several minute to load, does not start giving directions till several minutes into the drive. Picture in picture causes phone to lag severely and no way to disable feature. App has become borderline useless since latest update.
 
I am using this app for nearly 11 years but last update ruined my life. Googlae maps are failed to find the routs. I am a taxi driver i used to use it daily but now this update lost maps brain. Never worked since 3 weeks
 
I drive a motorhome, let me set height / weight restrictions, I tow a trailer, let me set max speed restrictions, I cycle, why can I not set max speed & milages per day and why does it route me onto motorways on a bicycle?, I walk but it routes me onto main roads without pavements instead of parallel country paths! And thinks I'm going to walk 70 miles in a day! Too many instructions for "do a U turn" or go down series of narrow side roads to do the same.
 
Was fine until most recent update. Now, you'll approach fork in road or exit and you'll hear nothing until you make wrong choice. Then you'll hear, "OK, do XYZ." Why aren't all route directions provided in advance??
 
App now drains my battery faster then I can charge. Have ample charger but app has massive drain even in background. Be sure to app kill and force close.
 
Awesome!!! Don't add too much to a great app & bloat it...driving mode works very well. Not good in gallery mode, constantly swapping orientation at each junction/sideroad very poor & distracting. Great to just explore in maps too
 
Horrible estimate of how long it'll take to drive to places where there's traffic. It routinely underestimates the drive time by 50% or more. As an example, today it told me this alternate route will take 20 minutes but ends up taking 30 minutes. This is in the Bay area, California
 
Mass transit WAY off course! I've consistently missed trains due to it inaccurately scheduling ride times off of DELAYED schedules that weren't even close to being delayed! Consistently missing hourly trains is so FRUSTRATING and affects my job status a ton!
 
I love the app, it gets me to where I need to go, however there is an option on IOS that isn't on Android, and it's very frustrating. I'd like the ability to play the directions over Bluetooth Phone call. The only way I can hear the directions through my vehicle, is to have it on Bluetooth, which means I can't listen to the radio or any other media input. The option is available on ios, and it works extremely well. If you put that ability on the Android system, I'd give you 5 stars.
 
Well from last week I am facing a problem of GPS signal lost. It becomes difficult when you are in transit to a direction and suddenly the signal gets lost and takes a lot of time to re gain the reception back however meanwhile I take a wrong turn or gets lost and needs to travel a lot to reach the final destination. I have checked with my service provider they said it's all ok from there end cusse I can use data services regularly on other apps. I am using Moto g 5s plus. Kindly rectify it at the earliest. Thanks in advance.
 
Last few weeks I've noticed I'm routed taking mostly right turns. By doing this it turned what should have been a 3 mile drive into one that took 15 miles. The 3 mile route had all left turns and wasn't even listed as one of the possible routes, and it was a straight shot on all main roads
 
What did you guys do to this app?? It's slow as all hell! Freezes up. And this new tiny map that comes up when you leave the main view sucks!
 
I hate the picture in picture feature bc i will using the app to get to my destination and all the way it will becomr smaller on my screen then i get distracted anx have to fix it. A big waste of time. Its pointless pic in pic. How do i shut that feature off?
 
I cannot find the bicycle routes now since last update, doesn't show anything to do with cycling. I found where the bike paths were from this app but now it doesn't It's Useless!!!
 
Great app, but have a few suggestions for improvement. 1. Let me put my labeled places into folders and to sort them. I store job sites in the labels have a huge list to scroll through, and if I save them the labels aren't present. 2. Add more route filters! I drive a tall work van and often get navigated to bridges I'm too big or heavy to cross, or lead straight up to a low overpass that I won't fit under. Fix those and I'll be more than happy to go 5 stars. Only other complaint is that "OK Google" does not always respond while navigating.
 
Why are you deleting my feedback? - (you can nrot view locations when you press it on he map when you have directions from a to z on, it works with no directions set thou, > I mean not on the direction steps I mean once u set the directions u can not like click somewhere random to see a - street view of that random place, when u still have the directions on) - [update this them I will certainly give you 5 stars thanks].
 
Following four critical features are missing. 1. Speed limit vs current speed 2. Road blocks, cops, speed trap, camera traps, etc. 3. Blue tooth does not work intermittently. 4. Offline map of a country to reduce dependency on signal.
 
This app doesn't show road closures in my area. One road has been closed for over a year and still shows as navigable. We had visitors who had to back track for miles because Google didn't show that road as being closed.
 
There's no way to safely drive and get directions with this app. It kept flipping between a small and big screen while I was driving making following directions impossible especially when trying to minimize time spent dealing with a phone
 
Good for planning before a trip, but I would never rely on it for navigation. Slow to start and can't trust it to get me there by the best route, if at all.
 
Recently maps orientiation does not sit right. In my phone the map sits inverted so becomes difficult while driving. But the turning sign at top are good
 
Thank you this is going me find I'm going where heading .help me alot I give u. 5. Stars Best App. I know. Get u A to B Quick thanks all. Best way find way around specially don't where you're at. Get there�⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐fanatic APP.
 
Latest update is a massive step backwards. I don't want to tell you my home and work addresses but it seems unless I do I can't search for any other place on the planet.
 
Google Maps is great my only gripe is the level of support when ur submitting address corrections, 8 requests and 2 months later still no change.. Yay Google!
 
This app used to be accurate but lately it has been terrible at giving me directions. If I have to walk 10 or more minutes from the train/bus to my destination, this thing has inaccurate turns and ends up leaving me lost and walking around in circles!
 
i use this app when i need to but when I am not using it and I play games or watch Netflix's video's or any thing even if it is just on the main screen it always pops up a message wanting me to turn on my location and I have to go in the this application settings and disable the app and force it to stop running just to keep the message from piping up constantly please fix
 
Can you please remove the "okay" that sounds before it gives a direction?! This was recently implemented in the last update, it's extremely annoying and unnecessary. Thank you.
 
Doesn't work... Says I live on a state road but when I look at street view it shows my subdivision in construction which means I can only conclude that you don't update your maps often. But I was wrong, when I "dropped a pin" on the road that you would turn on to enter my couldesack it showed actual addresses, and I realised that when I "dropped a pin" on any of the houses in my couldesack it showed the state road. Which means I can only conclude (again) that you don't like my couldesack. But I was wrong (again) when I went to "my places" in the menu I tried putting it my address and it showed the house 8 doors down from me (still in the couldesack) which I can only conclude (again) that; your maps are outdated, you don't like my couldesack, and you don't like my house in general. So if you would please be so kind to fix this I would greatly appreciate it. BTW I would give you my address so you could narrow down the problem but unfortunately I don't want to be broken into, robbed, etc. so sorry (I said so sorry sarcastically because you already have cause enough problems so I'm only returning the favor �).
 
I cannot believe some of the idiot replys on here . I have been using Google maps from the start and have never had any problems with it. However a few interface settings and other tweek settings would be useful but on the whole is better then some of the paid alternatives. You get what you pay for ..
 
Map is no longer responding on my LG G5 phone be in in data+gps mode. It just struck at e start point and not moving...
 
I just realized that this app causes screen burn-in when you use it for driving across countries. I just hope they update it so that pixels move a bit so that it will minimize the risk of burn in.
 
The app is not working.. it used to do wonders before the update. The location doesn't get updated on the move. The map is always up North even if it is changed.
 
Unfortunately it dosent lead me to reach my goal by voice turn off monitor after time and offline maps expire soon so we have to download them frequently. it's bad
 
I've turn off notification about "question about places", but notification about it still coming. It's disturbing me because as Local Guide I'm an expert reviewer, notification about place that I've been visited is coming every second.
 
App keeps losing my signal even tho everything else in my phone works fine. Even with my volume up it's not telling me where to turn before I already passed the street I was supposed to turn on. Doesn't show me the fastest/easiest way to get to one place to another. Keeps making me going in circle.
 
Good app to have, very helpful but updates way to much and at the worst times. Seems like every time I need it quick for something it has to update. It takes forever and makes me late
 
The latest version just doesn't work on my phone. Such a pain. When I ask for directions it simply doesn't load.
 
I've used this app. over several years and on multiple devices. It's always got me where I'm going. Runs great on my LG V30. It's been very accurate for me, couldn't ask for more! Thanks Google!
 
When negation is active and you zoom out the map and when you click on recenter button, it never works. I have close the map and then restart the negation. Hope Google is working already to fix this issues. I am using one plus 5
 
Ever since the update, it's been losing gps signal when I have perfect service. Horrible!!
 
The more updates the worse it gets. I used to love google maps but i was put in difficult situations because of this map. Well done.
 
It burned into my screen. Not apps fault. But they could do something to help with this, like manual night mode.
 
You suck in maps, useless for grabber as the time it takes to reroute takes ages even on the latest version of android. Your satellite is slow and your alternate routes doesn't exist. Get yourself updated more frequently on the routes to avoid pissing off users. Thank you.
 
Hopefully this update will fix the freezing up issue Ive been having. Havent been able to use this app for about a month now cause the screen will freeze up and will do nothing.
 
My husband had to uninstall all updates after the latest update as GPS no longer works so I'm about to do the same. What rubbish, Google!
 
Issue in this new update , current location is showing wrong followed by wrong directions , I have checked and verified by many devices all are facing similar issues,kindly do the needful
 
I would give it 5 stars but the app does not let me lower the voice command volume while i'm listening to music on other apps. Pls work on this
 
It is constantly searching for gps, doesn't ever complete the drive before it the arrow stops moving and then doesn't know Where I am, I work around the country and I never had any problems with it until I got the Samsung s9 plus, it now can not direct me as it just stops working 2 mins after I start navigation! Very frustrating when you don't know where you are and you need this to work properly to reach destination. Sort it out please ! I have done everything to try fix it myself, update it, download it again, clear cache ect and it still doesn't not work !!!!!
 
Maps constantly crashes when I'm trying to search in my surrounding area. Very frustrating when I'm in an unfamiliar city and need to find somewhere to eat!
 
Its a great app but i think you should also give us the facility to see the speed limit of ongoing road,street or highway!
 
The navigation light won't turn on. The blue light just went off have tried so many times to Uninstall and update still won't work..
 
Still Locked up, can't use will not accept any inputs. Open app but unable to enter anything, the touch screen is not responsive-- even after latest update!
 
Now a day's maps can't show exact route direction and also taking too much of time to detect own location..
 
Navigation has stopped working. Reinstalled and still nothing. Have to manually press recentre to get position. Used to work :-(
 
It's not properly work and show the arrow he is not fixed proper point he move on the left and right.please chack this
 
Offline mode is pointless and just wastes device space. And bus directions are wrong, I used this app to go somewhere for an interview, I followed it correctly and it put me on the wrong buses, I even showed bus drivers the information it was giving me... basically it got me lost like twice which was very worrying for me since I rarely go out and suffer from terrible anxiety.
 
Can never find my location. And when I am home, the blue dote is always miles away from my true location. With wifi or data it don't matter.
 
This app doesn't work properly. The navigation is almost always off and doesn't show the right destination on the phone. Really need this thing to be accurate in order to play Pokemon Go, but it isn't.
 
The routing will consistently take you a slower way every time, taking random rurns that make no sense.
 
Thanks for adding bike route. One issue is that the blue dots' wandering around and it's being shown in my history...
 
I never had this problem until they changed the layout, but I am now the proud owner of OLED burn in! Yes that's right you can also forever see the shadows of Google maps on your screen ALL THE TIME!
 
It very irritating when I can't see other routes for a selected route. Why this happened.
 
Need to include Road Specific speed. Limit alerts and Warnings.. This feature was available long ago in NOKIA Maps.... Miss it a Lot
 
Offline capabilities are horrendous, despite having maps downloaded. It can't find anything.
 
Never loads, or can accurately reroute or figure out where I am. It is fairly stressful actually.
 
Update: How can I hide the transit icon at bottom. I own a car and have used public transportation once, and that was over 15 years ago. I never want to see this at the bottom. Please help. This could be a five-star app but for some reason my maps expire. Please tell me how Maps can expire. Terable app.
 
Where's the blue preview driving line gone when looking for directions? The dotted line is there when walking is selected
 
This is best app for the people who loves to travel without knowing the places where they are....in short awesome...
 
Used to be excellent but recently has become so slow and unwieldy that it's sometimes unusable.
 
If google add speed limit and camera for paid version Im ready to go with it so I dont have to use Tomtom
 
Used it for 10 years by now. Made my map in "Your Maps" using color and shape pins to map my customers and prospects. Lately my map shows all the pins white. Sucks, I cant quickly identify what pin are around me
 
The one thing i really hate about this app is that no matter how I try, even following all directions i cannot change the voice from female to male. I can change the voice on everything else from female to male but not this app. I really wish google would fix that because it really irritates me.
 
Really slow on my Samsung S7. Slows the phone down to crawl when running
 
Is it too much to ask to get which side of the street my destination is on? Google needs to employ people with an IQ over 40. This app continues to get worse. Try testing this app with people not on ur payroll.
 
My device location is inappropriate.... It's showing my device is 15 kms away from my place
 
This app used to work great, but now even in good weather it can't seem to locate the GPS satellite and I have been stranded a few times because the directions failed.
 
Not sure but constantly searching for GPS. Got lost .... ☹
 
After update to 9.81.1 google map cannot show taxi ride information such as fare calculation in Singapore. It shows error saying "Cant find way there". Before update it can shows GRAB ride information. FIX PLEASE
 
I have a love-hate relationship with this app. I love how easy it works but I hate how much I rely on it to get anywhere promptly.
 
The new update is horrible. They want to advertise to you and make it a social platform. I use it for map directions and for that it takes so long to load now. Doesn't work like before.
 
The white 3d buildings that you see when you zoom in have been broken for a while now. They are rendered incorrectly. Installed an older version until they fix this problem.
 
It's as if the app has no ides where I am at times. Just giving random directions. If I didn't know part of the way, I would have been COMPLETELY lost.
 
I used it and I didn't like the directions given while but now that I've used it, it's getting better. I really wish there was a way to add another piece to this such as Driving Powerchair because that's all I drive. Now being that I have a new cellphone, I'm not sure if this app is going to show me the new or the old map.
 
Even more reliable. Enhanced navigation through jakarta traffic. Thanks gmaps team!
 
So many great features but also extremely slow. Requires high-end hardware to be useful.
 
Nice app but I do hate several aspects of it. It needs to be customizable so I can see what I want to and no more.
 
Useless app now. Very difficult to use it while driving. Some time direction vanish and say go to that "x" road.. if i knew it why should I ask them.
 
Tried to use this app to get to a structure fire today and the location wasn't listed. It needs to include more rural areas. It didn't even recognize that the road existed
 
With this recent update maps is not able to access my location
 
It's a great app to get you on the go and on the fastest route�����
 
The motor-bike route is neat. But miss some road (ex soekarno-hatta, bandung) in fact the road is bike-able too.
 
I Sure HOPE This Time It's Not Wasting my Time & Data. You've Got Get Something Right Eventually I'm Getting Tired of Waiting & Paying For B.S.�
 
Very usefull when i forgotten or lost my way to journey i open this and gooo... to right place. Thanks
 
Bei dieser app lädt rein gar nichts, obwohl meine internetverbindung gut ist und die app auf dem neusten stand ist
 
Had a better voice before I do not know why they do not put a more human voice.
 
I think it's cool you guys give points and stuff for our opinion and stuff.
 
Wonderful app.this app makes me to feel like i can go anywhere without any doubts of routes.
 
Does not show exact location nor nearest famous place.
 
This is the best invention ever created in the 21st century! I take it for granted because it's that good!
 
Navigation has stopped working after the recent app update on my Pixel and it only works after you uninstall all the updates.
 
You need fix the bugs!!! Simply the arrow don't appear when start the route. Please, fix it!!! Mu smartphpne is LG G5
 
This was the best app ever. I use it on a daily basis. But, for some reason, it is not working !!!!! Fix the problem !!!!!!
 
Majority of the time Maps works! �It's very useful to use when one needs it. But offline it doesn't work so well. Any suggestions? � Thank you ~ �
 
Talks too much and it doesn't really work on my phone
 
The upgrades where she says ( OKAY ) 57,000 times a day are annoying!!!!!!loved this app before I use it all day for work... UGH!!!
 
Finding current location, still a mess short it out before IRNSS start its services in south Asian region...
 
Maps often gives wrong bus stop location in Hong Kong and says I'm in the middle of buildings when on sidewalks
 
Love this app. Would give more stars if it announced name of roads (I don't care if it is not the correct pronunciation). It helps so I don't have to look for the name of the road on my phone while driving.
 
Asks for device's location. If I deny, it keeps asking repeatedly which prevents me from using the app at all.
 
Will frequently tell me to get on the wrong bus, and doesn't have any way to report it as an issue.
 
UI became very slow. Previous version is good. With the latest version app became very slow.
 
I use this app everyday why can't you have speed limit and speed cameras speed gun.
 
Don't depend on Google maps for navigation needs. This app needs to be fixed with a few more fine tuning.
 
Loving it !!! Can you please provide us the upcoming metro routes of phase 3 and 4 So that we may get the idea of the location of metro station and and other routes from there for our convenience ?
 
On an 2015 Ellipsis 10, Maps crashes on opening.
 
After latest update I can't measure distance in map (android).please solve this issue
 
Looks like they finally have the GPS issue fixed. Locates much faster now
 
I use it everyday if it wasn't good I would not use it as long as you got internet connection satellite that works good
 
It's not accurate and specific. I found difficulty in searching city buses and bus stands..
 
App has become pretty much unusable on my Galaxy S7 Edge. Takes over a minute to load and anywhere from 5-30 seconds to respond to any interaction.
 
Very inaccurate when walking. And when driving, the app constantly uses u -turns for every destination.
 
One of the best things that happened to the web.. And it keeps getting better
 
This was a good app and i use it for work but now it stop working all to give
 
satellite not showing proper location, need to improve satellite
 
Very useful app. Don't have to think twice if you want to use it
 
Since the last update, the map isn't loading, even with a strong Internet connection. Please fix it!
 
Since the recent update my maps have stopped working properly. It always shows 'searching for gps' and doesn't show me turn by turn route anymore
 
Always "Searching for GPS". For me now MAPS is unusable. How can I solve the problem?
 
can u send me a link?where can i suggest some edits with regards to the location of a city or municipality in which it is supposed to be located in a coastal area.yet your maps showed it is loxated in a mountainous area.thank you
 
The bus and train transportation doesn't work, which ruins a solid amount of its purpose
 
After update it stopped showing bike mode in pixel
 
needs to show all route options whether it's the fastest or not! Other than that the best GPS app out there! Flawless!
 
Always taking me to the wrong place and longer routes
 
It's still out of date please up date to 2017
 
Can no longer create list of places. There is no + in corner of saved places screen to tap to start a new list. (Unless they've changed the mechanism, hidden it very cleverly, and not updated the instruction in Help. I sometimes get tired of being so cynical but that kind of thing happens too often to discount as a real possibility ...)
 
An absolutely essential app. It needs to improve it's detection of road closures however.
 
I have uses for ages and would have given us five most times, but now I can't get to the driving directions because it wants to sell me uber
 
Siguen con errores ya nisiquiera me marca donde me encuentro desde la actualización pasada me manda como a 7 km de mi ubicación actual, ni para usarlo en ruta, luego lo pierde a uno
 
I love the app!, But with the last 5 or so updates, I can't get it to run. This is on a Verizon Ellipsis 10 with 5.1 Android. It will run if I uninstall the updates
 
I'm not impressed by the redirect form the web to the app. Every time I submit navigate it redirects me to theplay store and there's no map selecting. Frustrating
 
While using roaming data in Italy, maps used 1.5GB of data during a 3 h highway trip, with maps predownloaded... Data saver was also enabled. Good job Google.
 
Right when you need to get somewhere. I hate this app soooo much.
 
Will get your ass lost. Sends u in the wrong direction
 
Please update daily fare route activity store in Gmail account with start time to last time, when he used Google map application
 
Ga fungsi di kota kecil...sering tersesat pake app ini...khusus kota besar baru berguna..
 
Really good I use this instead of my satnav only thing I find odd is when the voice switches from an English to an American lady during directions
 
Does NOT show the directions and when moving the for stays in the same place. Ridiculous.
 
Finally fixed the issues and it's now showing live traffic information.
 
Too manny updates make it poor! Was the Best ap ever, but now is rubbish!
 
Does not show accurate time for transit
 
I NEED audible directions when I'm driving. Looking at phone is a distraction but app no longer gives me AUDIBLE guidance. What's up with that? YES I've selected every volume choice I'm given and I get no response. Please fix this.
 
Gmaps won't let me in and I'm signed up about dated but it still won't let me in
 
Crashing on me frequently mid-trip since the last update.
 
By taking some time to learn how to use Maps I really love using it.
 
Would not move my location as soon as I tried going to my destination I was lost. So I couldn't find my destination.
 
Like Real time work and supportive and helpful application for individual , who is out of own town. " Application really Help like Eyes to Blind " we love it.
 
Live location not accurate And facing navigation problem...Fix it
 
1st app has feature bike drive mode. but now days It is not seen. please start again. require for maximum shortcut road for bikes
 
This app talking too much LOL
 
I like this .my traval is very good.
 
But any one problem my location is not perfect
 
If your looking for an app that never works this is for you.
 
Great app very helpful. Thanks
 
I drive for a living yet timeline shows nothing. I ha e all settings on to record my timeline but it has not worked for the last 4 weeks.
 
I am a .heavy driver,since now, i had not got any problem in my routeing all over INDIA
 
There was an option world map on the menu...now i couldn't find it in my menu...how do i get it back... please let me know if you know
 
not so good
 
This app has revolutionized the way we used to ask for directions. Satellite map & live traffic are really cool. Plus, the Local Guides is great.
 
Too much talking on the app it interrupts my music
 
Older version was better than newer. New version is slow. Please avoid to update it.
 
I would like to see my labels and not the "dropped pin" label
 
You can get the information, and also you can contribute...
 
Why can't see multi rout search.
 
There is no option to speed while driving,
 
Just like god bless for me
 
Very good location but reason
 
All over app is too good but application dont have marathi language so please add marathi language as early as possible like other indian language
 
This update is very laggy
 
Good app I wish Google would keep me on highways rather then shortest route. But they never will
 
Ever since the update on S7 edge, its crashing a lot and freezing the entire phone!!!!!!!!
 
Best application for searching places.
 
Very valuable and useful application �
 
The undisputed king of all apps.
 
App is ok but could do with a dedicated button for location sharing
 
Fight man. Please dont give up ok...
 
After update more not accurate on location
 
My navigation not working properly resolve it
 
bad service not adding my places
 
Superb app for mapping great job by Google, � accurateinformation.360 photos very helpful, future mapping from Google maps,thanks for Google very easy to find the best way to travel
 
I drive a lot for work and though some streets are not accurate, this app works really good.
 
I'm used a number of map/navigation apps and nothing beats google maps. Its frequently updated and very intuitive.
 
Hello maps team I want to become beta tester but your link not working what I do next
 
This app now become part of life...
 
New Update lags so much.
 
It does not show proper route...
 
I AM USING GOOGLE AS GOGGLES
 
Works well but sometimes has trouble rerouting fast enough
 
Search for restaurant, only see ratings/reviews. No location and button for direction. This is maps not Zomato/Yelp.
 
Take too much time to find my location rute.
 
Multiple photo selection for uploading is not working after the update. I am using photos app as default.
 
There's no options for Jakarta traffic even-odd on route option, please fixed. Thank you.
 
Over the years, has become the standard of navigation and apps in general. Occasional mistakes, but mostly perfect.
 
Very slow after the update.
 
Well after the big updates maps stop all the time and you don't have to be in maps just turn it on and it show maps has stoped
 
Few time it show wrong location
 
I most of the time relay on it for moving around.. But why did u removed the option of sharing my trip progress???
 
Not correct location indicate sometime
 
Love it...... Maps help in mee
 
It got better but freezes the whole phone. Galaxy s8+ user here.
 
Most of the time it works great. Sometimes it doesn't know when roads are closed for maintenance.
 
Worst update taking so much time to find route previous version was better
 
Very good app, but I wish the app would show the road speed limit and show mileage scale on the map.
 
Waste of space on my phone.
 
Very difficult to find the transportation .before it was good later it got update not nice
 
It is the best mapping service app in the world.I use this every traveling to get the fatest and best route and see reaching time
 
Why bother with anything else?
 
I think the app is good. It would be nice for the GPS to detect and indicate what the speed limit is while driving.
 
New update takes too much time to loading the maps.
 
Still no signal in the Domain tunnel/ Burnley tunnel in Melbourne. But wifi on and phonesignal on Max.
 
Not finding exact location
 
Why there is no Super Mario in my Google Maps after the latest update just now???
 
This app is awesome .it help to explore new places as well as to find shopping , working , parking etc places
 
Very very slow to start
 
I never get lost
 
Maps does not show any blue roads anymore. Lost it when i updated.
 
Love the real time location fibdwr to assist in shopping in area where I am at. Also event locator in real time.

I love the transit feature. It helps me navigate and travel on time
 
I love it :-) I like this App because it helps me get from place 2 place easly
